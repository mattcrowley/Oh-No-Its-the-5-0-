# Oh-No-Its-the-5-0-
Created as a joint effort between myself and 3 other developers in 2012. This was our first team project in our second semester of learning programming. Our assignment was open ended: create a game using any technology that is 2 player, and using graphics instead of text. 
We ultimately decided to use a UI was to use SFML. 
This project was done within a few weeks. This project was originally developed using VS2008, and was recently updated by me to compile and run using VS2015 instead. 

  
# Instructions on how to play 
The game is called Oh No! Here's 5-0! It is a car game, where you basically avoid the obstacles, trying to beat
the other player in how many lives you have remaining. Player 1 controls the car with WASD, and player 2 controls
the car with Up/Down/Left/Right, which can be seen in the instructions page. There are 3 lives total for each player.

There are two modes to this game: Racing and Survival. 

Racing is where you want to try to end up with the most lives left at the end of 60 seconds. The game ends 
once 60 seconds have passed, and then the game over screen is shown, with the winning player.

Survival is where you race endlessly, until one player runs out of lives. 

There are menus for the main screen, with a nice splash screen, a main menu image, the instructions page, as
well as the winner's image. These are included with the zip file that has all the code.


# Instructions on how to set up the project.
1. In this project, we wrote the code using SFML 1.6, and I include this code in the repository.
2. If you do not have the SFML 1.6 files, or want to grab them directly from the source, download the files on SFML's website
  selecting SFML full SDK (headers / libraries / documentation / sources / samples / external libraries).
3. The SFML1.6 library files were compiled using VS2015. Thus, you should use VS2015 to compile and run this app.
   - Note: You can recompile the SFML project files if you want to use a different version of Visual Studio instead. The original library files checked in were compiled to work with VS2008.
